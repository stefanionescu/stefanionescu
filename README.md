# Hey, I’m Stefan 👋

Right now I’m building **Yap**, a voice consumer app where you can talk with an LLM that *sees your phone screen*.  
It can roast TikToks, analyze dating profiles, help you draft messages/emails and much more. Launch date TBD.  

Some open-source infra experiments around Yap (not the actual app code) live here:  
- [yap-kokoro-tts-api](https://github.com/stefanionescu/yap-kokoro-tts-api) – deployment scripts & API for Kokoro TTS  
- [yap-kyutai-tts-api](https://github.com/stefanionescu/yap-kyutai-tts-api) – deployment scripts & benchmark tests for Kyutai TTS (Moshi + 1.6B EN/FR model)
- [yap-smart-turn-v2](https://github.com/stefanionescu/yap-vad-smart-turn-v2) - deployment scripts for a lightweight VAD model developed by Pipecat. Deprecated in favor of V3 that can run on CPU

## 🧑‍🚀 Before Yap: RAI
A few years back I worked on **RAI**, a floating-peg stablecoin backed by ETH.
RAI uses a **PI controller** to set its own funding rate (similar to a perp swap’s funding mechanism) and was my attempt at fulfilling the original vision for DAI.
We scaled the system to $390M in user funds.

Repos from that era:  
- [geb](https://github.com/stefanionescu/geb) – main code for RAI  
- [geb-rrfm-rate-setter](https://github.com/stefanionescu/geb-rrfm-rate-setter) – the redemption rate feedback mechanism (controller that sets the funding rate)  
- [geb-safe-saviours](https://github.com/stefanionescu/geb-safe-saviours) – adapters to deposit assets/wrapped tokens from other protocols into RAI-like systems. The deposited assets get auctioned to save CDPs from liquidation.  

**RAI was basically a super nerdy modified DAI fork.**

## 🎭 What I’ve been hacking on since
After crypto, I moved on to building consumer apps. Life’s too short to do boring ass B2B. A few highlights:  

- [llm-roleplay-webapp](https://github.com/stefanionescu/llm-roleplay-webapp) – think *Character.ai x TikTok*.  
  - Used `react-virtua` for efficient chat virtualization  
  - Related repos:  
    - [llm-inference-load-balancer](https://github.com/stefanionescu/llm-inference-load-balancer) – distribute inference requests across providers, scaling Llama models to 1000+ DAU  
    - [llm-roleplay-main-api](https://github.com/stefanionescu/llm-roleplay-main-api) – RAG + waitlist API  
    - [redis-user-waitlist](https://github.com/stefanionescu/redis-user-waitlist) – customizable Redis waitlist that actually scales  

- [yc-cofounder-matching-bot](https://github.com/stefanionescu/yc-cofounder-matching-bot) – a Selenium bot I built to automatically hunt for cofounders on YC’s Cofounder Matching platform.  
  - Can change locations to search in different cities  
  - Filtered + saved founders, sent them messages with your own templates  
  - Used GPT to decide if a profile was a fit or not  
  - Sent you email reports with stats from each run  
  (⚠️ Deprecated now due to YC’s security upgrades, but still a fun hack.)  

- [suno-music-discord-bot](https://github.com/stefanionescu/suno-music-discord-bot) – generate music from images/videos inside Discord.  
  (Yes, it scrapes Suno.com under the hood. Don’t tell them. 🙃)

## 🌍 TL;DR
- Built **RAI** (floating-peg ETH-backed stablecoin w/ PI controller funding rate)  
- Now building **Yap** (voice-first consumer AI app w/ screen awareness)  
- In between: I worked a few years as project lead for a decentralized exchange that got to $1B+ in user funds. Decided to leave crypto at the end of 2023 and then started shipping a bunch of fun/weird consumer projects.

I love building products that are weird, unhinged and could not exist before LLMs came around.
If you’re into that too, reach out and say hi 🤝
